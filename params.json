  "body": "# openc - Helper for OpenConnect\r\n\r\n`openc.pl` is a command-line helper to automate portions of making OpenConnect VPN connections. It has a lot of bugs, and should be considered **Alpha** status software. I use it daily, but it's very much *works on my machine*.\r\n\r\nIt is written in Perl because I hate you.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly interesting because it interacts with another command-line program using IO streams; see the `stream()` sub for details.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nYou must install [OpenConnect](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/), version 7.06 or higher. The `openconnect` binary must be in your PATH.\r\n\r\nYou must install the [`stoken` utility](http://stoken.sf.net), and `stoken` must be in your PATH. (Some token configs do not work with OpenConnect's libstoken support, the CLI always works so we use it instead).\r\n\r\nThis requires Perl 5.23 or higher for security purposes, though older Perls may work.\r\n\r\nIf you're on a system where having that recent of a Perl is a problem (OS X, I'm looking at you), or if you want an isolated CPAN install, consider using [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl) to install an isolated version, then change the `openc.pl` shebang to point to it.\r\n\r\nDepending on your Perl distribution, you may need to the following CPAN modules:\r\n\r\n* Getopt::Long\r\n* Term::ReadPassword\r\n\r\nIf using Perlbrew, make sure you use its `cpan` when installing.\r\n\r\n# First run\r\n\r\nOn first run for a given VPN server hostname, it prompts for setup before connecting:\r\n\r\n    openc.pl vpn.server.host\r\n    Enter username [ubuntu]: myuser\r\n\r\n    You can connect using one of the following profiles::\r\n      1. Split_Tunnel_(DEFAULT)\r\n      2. From_Public_WiFi\r\n      3. Contractor\r\n    Choose default profile [1]:\r\n    Using 'Split_Tunnel_(DEFAULT)' as default profile\r\n    Connection password for myuser: *******************\r\n    # Group: Split_Tunnel_(DEFAULT)\r\n    Token code: ******\r\n    # Sent password\r\n    Connected! Ctrl-C to disconnect\r\n\r\nFrom then on, you'll only be prompted for authentication on that server unless you provide certain command-line arguments\r\n\r\n# Running\r\n\r\n    openc.pl [args] vpn.server.host\r\n\r\n    --profile    : alternate connection profile/group; if no name is provided,\r\n                   presents a list of choices from the configuration file\r\n    --password   : a path to a password -file- containing a connection password.\r\n                   the mode must be less than or equal to 0600; if not specified,\r\n                   will use ~/.opencpw\r\n    --sudo       : use the connection password as your local sudo password\r\n                   otherwise you'll be prompted for a sudo password\r\n    --user       : connect as a different user than the one in the config file,\r\n                   you must supply the name, you will not be prompted\r\n    --rsa        : use an RSA soft token stored in ~/.stokenrc\r\n    --log        : log openconnect STDERR to stderr.log and STDOUT to stdout.log\r\n\r\nConfiguration is in `~/.openc`\r\n\r\nIf you use `--password` or `--profile` without a parameter, you need to use `--` to indicate the end of the parameter line, like so:\r\n\r\n    openc.pl --profile -- vpn.server.host\r\n\r\nIf you set the environment variable `DEBUG` to a True value (e.g. `1`), openc will be more verbose and add timestamps to each thing it writes to the console.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThis software is **alpha** and provided **without warranty of any kind, express or implied**. Use it at your own risk, since it has not been tested thoroughly and might cause issues.\r\n\r\n## Why we use the `stoken` command\r\n\r\nOpenConnect supports RSA soft tokens through `libstoken`. This works 98% of the time, but doesn't work with:\r\n\r\n* Certain unusal token configurations\r\n* Situations where you need to enter the next token code to re-sync\r\n\r\nUsing the `stoken` command is more fragile, in that it requires another external moving part; however, it handles every case I've been able to throw at it, unlike OpenConnect's built-in support.\r\n\r\n# LICENSE (BSD 2-clause)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016, Darren P Meyer\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.
